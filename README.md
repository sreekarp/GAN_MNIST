# GAN_MNIST

Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Project on MNIST Dataset
This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating handwritten digit images using the MNIST dataset. GANs are a class of deep learning models designed to generate synthetic data that is similar to a given training dataset. In this project, we focus on generating realistic handwritten digit images resembling the ones found in the MNIST dataset.
